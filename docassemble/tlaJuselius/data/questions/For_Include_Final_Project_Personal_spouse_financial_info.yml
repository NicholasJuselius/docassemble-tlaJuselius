question:  |
  Are you or your spouse claiming spousal support, pension, medical benefits, or other benefits?
Subquestion:  |
  If it is possible that you or your spouse may want to claim spousal support or be entitled to pension or other benefits, you must seek legal advice before participating in the DYOD Clinic.
yesno: user.claim_support
help: |
  SLS is not able to directly assist with claims for spousal support. However, we can provide general information about spousal support. There are three aspects to be considered in determining spousal support: entitlement, duration, and quantum. 

  There are three grounds for entitlement to spousal support. A spouse may have a claim under one or  more of these grounds.  
  
  1. Compensatory: this is typically awarded as compensation for sacrifices made as part of the marriage. For example, if one party worked and developed their career during the marriage while the other party stayed at home looking after children, they may be entitled to an award of  compensatory support.  
  
  2. Non-compensatory: Also referred to as needs-based, the rationale for this kind of support is that a spouse who has financial need after a marriage should be supported by their former spouse. 3. Contractual: spouses can contract into an agreement to provide spousal support.  

  Typically, if entitlement is established, the duration of support is between 0.5-1 year for each year of  marriage. Marriages over 20 years tend to give rise to indefinite support orders.  

  Quantum (i.e. how much support should be paid) is a much more complicated topic, especially when child support is involved. The formulas for calculating a range can be found in the Spousal Support Advisory Guidelines (SSAG). The SSAG are not binding, but often awards of spousal support fall within the ranges set out in the SSAG.  

  Spousal support is a complex area of law. Callers wishing to know about their specific entitlements should consult with a lawyer.
