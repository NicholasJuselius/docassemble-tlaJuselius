  If you and your spouse disagree on custody, parenting, or child support, you both must speak to your own lawyers before proceeding with the DYOD Clinic.
  The Federal Child Support Lookup Table is [here](https://justice.gc.ca/eng/fl-df/child-enfant/2017/look-rech.asp).
  If you have not taken the Parenting After Separation course, you may proceed with the clinic, but your divorce cannot be finalized until the PAS certificate is registered with the court. The Parenting After Divorce course is found [here](https://www.alberta.ca/pas.aspx).
